# TicTacToeAR

This repository contains source code for augmented reality based tic-tac-toe game. To provide more flexibility, four modes are proposed for playing the game: Single Player where the user plays against AI, Local Multiplayer where the user can play with a friend on the same device and Online Multiplayer where the user and their friend can play on their own devices over a local network and Online Multiplayer Synchronized which is similar to Online Multiplayer but lets the users play on the same grid in the same 3D space.

This game can be launched on any Android phone which supports ARCore. For more information, please visit the website: https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices. 

This project was implemented using the Unity Platform and AR Foundation API with ARCore extension. The scripts implementing the algorithms were written in C#. 

Please find the video below to visualize the game.
